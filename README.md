## Overview

This project is a product management dashboard developed using **React**. It provides a user interface for viewing and editing product information, including images, names, prices, brands, and categories.

## Technologies Used

### **React**
- **Description**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience.
- **Why Used**: React allows for efficient updates and rendering of components, creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.

### **Next.js**
- **Description**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Why Used**: (If used) Provides optimized performance and SEO benefits by rendering pages on the server.

### **Database**
- **Description**: Database solutions such as MongoDB for storing product data.
- **Why Used**: (If used) Manages and persists product information efficiently.

- **Why Used**: (If used) Provides a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests and building server-side logic.

### **Jest**
- **Description**: A testing framework for JavaScript.
- **Why Used**: (If used) Enables writing and running tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
